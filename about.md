Hello, I’m Riley :)

<br>

I study mathematics and computer science at UC Berkeley. 
I’m passionate about machine learning, and actively pursue research in deep learning.


I live in Chicago, but grew up in Lucca, Italy. In my free time, I like to explore nature, spend quality time with friends, and read.


After graduation I plan to pursue a PhD in artificial intelligence.
